- Default to server components; mark client components only for interactivity or browser-only APIs.
- App Router patterns: use `layout/page/loading/error` per segment; wire `generateMetadata` for SEO; avoid duplicate fetches across nested routes; prefer route handlers (`route.ts`) for API glue.
- Data fetching: server actions or route handlers with `fetch` using explicit `cache`/`revalidate` or `no-store`; prefer POST server actions for mutations; never `SELECT *` in API layers.
- State/UX: cover loading/empty/error states; consider optimistic UI only when conflict risk is low; guard concurrent submissions with pending states.
- Forms: use server actions where possible; validate on the server; keep client-side validation minimal and user-focused.
- Styling and structure: Tailwind-first; keep components small/composable; avoid inline styles except for dynamic values; use semantic HTML and accessible labels/aria.
- Routing/contracts: keep API proxy paths aligned with backend routes; respect dynamic params (`[id]`); avoid client-only data fetching when server-side is viable.

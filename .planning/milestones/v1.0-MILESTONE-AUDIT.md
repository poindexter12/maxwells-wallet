# Milestone v1.0 Re-Audit: DevSecOps Tooling Integration

**Re-audited:** 2026-02-23T19:30:00Z
**Previous audit:** 2026-02-23T17:25:00Z (status: gaps_found — missing VERIFICATION.md for Phases 2–5)
**Current status:** TECH DEBT (all requirements functionally satisfied, procedural items remain)
**Gap closure:** Phase 6 created VERIFICATION.md for Phases 2–5, resolving all prior critical gaps

## Executive Summary

All 28 v1 requirements are functionally satisfied with passing VERIFICATION.md evidence and checked-off traceability. The previous audit's `gaps_found` status (missing VERIFICATION.md for Phases 2–5) has been fully resolved by Phase 6 (Formal Verification Sweep). The integration checker confirms all 12 cross-phase connections are wired and all 5 E2E flows complete end-to-end.

**Remaining items:** Minor procedural tech debt (SUMMARY frontmatter format gap in Phase 1, Phase 6 meta-phase lacks own VERIFICATION.md) and known v2-deferred limitations (ZAP tuning, authenticated scanning).

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 1: Foundation & SAST

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| CROSS-01 | ✓ passed (01-VERIFICATION) | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| CROSS-02 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| CROSS-03 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| CROSS-04 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| CROSS-05 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| SAST-01 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| SAST-02 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| SAST-03 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| SAST-04 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |
| SAST-05 | ✓ passed | ✗ not in frontmatter | `[x]` | **partial** |

**Phase 1: 10/10 functionally satisfied, 0/10 full 3-source (01-01-SUMMARY.md lacks `requirements_completed` frontmatter field)**

**Note:** All 10 requirements have file:line evidence in 01-VERIFICATION.md and are listed in the body of 01-01-SUMMARY.md under "Requirements Satisfied". The gap is strictly a YAML frontmatter format issue, not a functional gap.

### Phase 2: SCA & Repository Health

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| SCA-01 | ✓ passed (02-VERIFICATION) | ✓ listed (02-01-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCA-02 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCA-03 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCA-04 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCORE-01 | ✓ passed (02-VERIFICATION) | ✓ listed (02-02-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCORE-02 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCORE-03 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| SCORE-04 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**Phase 2: 8/8 satisfied (full 3-source traceability)**

### Phase 3: Container Scanning

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| CNTR-01 | ✓ passed (03-VERIFICATION) | ✓ listed (03-01-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| CNTR-02 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| CNTR-03 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| CNTR-04 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**Phase 3: 4/4 satisfied (full 3-source traceability)**

### Phase 4: DAST

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| DAST-01 | ✓ passed (04-VERIFICATION) | ✓ listed (04-01-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DAST-02 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DAST-03 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DAST-04 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**Phase 4: 4/4 satisfied (full 3-source traceability)**

### Phase 5: Documentation

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| DOCS-01 | ✓ passed (05-VERIFICATION) | ✓ listed (06-01-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| DOCS-02 | ✓ passed | ✓ listed (06-01-SUMMARY) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**Phase 5: 2/2 satisfied (SUMMARY source via Phase 6's verification sweep SUMMARY)**

### Coverage Totals

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **satisfied** (full 3-source) | 18/28 | 64% |
| **partial** (VERIFICATION + REQUIREMENTS, missing SUMMARY frontmatter) | 10/28 | 36% |
| **unsatisfied** | 0/28 | 0% |
| **orphaned** | 0/28 | 0% |
| **Functionally complete** | **28/28** | **100%** |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: PASSED** (12/12 integration points verified by gsd-integration-checker)

| # | Integration Point | Status |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Reusable workflow pattern (security.yaml → ci.yaml + nightly.yaml) | ✓ WIRED |
| 2 | SARIF category uniqueness (5 unique: semgrep, dependency-check, scorecard, trivy-container, zap) | ✓ WIRED |
| 3 | SHA pinning across all workflows (zero @v tags) | ✓ WIRED |
| 4 | Non-blocking execution (continue-on-error on all 5 tools) | ✓ WIRED |
| 5 | Docker image consistency (Trivy scans same image DAST uses) | ✓ WIRED |
| 6 | Documentation accuracy (README matches all workflow implementations) | ✓ WIRED |
| 7 | NVD cache with 24-hour TTL | ✓ WIRED |
| 8 | Health check pattern reuse (DAST matches ci.yaml docker job) | ✓ WIRED |
| 9 | Scorecard isolation (separate workflow per OpenSSF API requirements) | ✓ WIRED |
| 10 | Job-level permissions (least privilege across all workflows) | ✓ WIRED |
| 11 | Trivy positioning (before buildx conditional, runs on all builds) | ✓ WIRED |
| 12 | SARIF upload pattern consistency (same SHA-pinned action, all use if: always()) | ✓ WIRED |

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Path |
|------|--------|------|
| Push to main → all scans | ✓ COMPLETE | ci.yaml → security.yaml (semgrep + dep-check) + docker/Trivy + dast.yaml/ZAP + scorecard.yaml |
| PR → SAST + Container | ✓ COMPLETE | ci.yaml → security.yaml (semgrep) + docker/Trivy on PR builds |
| Nightly → full scans | ✓ COMPLETE | nightly.yaml → security.yaml (full mode) + scorecard weekly schedule |
| Finding → Security tab | ✓ COMPLETE | SARIF upload → category filter → finding detail with remediation |
| ZAP report artifacts | ✓ COMPLETE | dast.yaml → HTML/Markdown reports → 30-day artifact retention |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Score | Anti-Patterns |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------|---------------|
| 01-foundation-sast | ✓ 01-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 8/8 truths, 10/10 reqs | None |
| 02-sca-repository-health | ✓ 02-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 8/8 truths, 8/8 reqs | None |
| 03-container-scanning | ✓ 03-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 6/6 truths, 4/4 reqs | None |
| 04-dast | ✓ 04-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 7/7 truths, 4/4 reqs | None |
| 05-documentation | ✓ 05-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 9/9 truths, 2/2 reqs | None |
| 06-formal-verification-sweep | ✗ none (meta-phase) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**5/5 implementation phases formally verified. Phase 6 is a meta-phase (created verification artifacts).**

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity | Deferred To |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| 01-foundation-sast | 01-01-SUMMARY.md lacks `requirements_completed` YAML frontmatter (body text has them) | Low | Backlog |
| 04-dast | ZAP baseline expected to produce 50-200 findings before tuning | Info | DAST-V2-03 |
| 04-dast | ZAP scans public pages only, no authenticated scanning | Info | DAST-V2-01 |
| 04-dast | ZAP targets frontend only, backend API not directly scanned | Info | DAST-V2-02 |
| 06-formal-verification-sweep | Meta-phase has no VERIFICATION.md | Low | Backlog |

**Total: 5 items (2 low procedural, 3 informational v2-deferred)**

## Orphaned Requirements

**None.** All 28 v1 requirements appear in phase VERIFICATION.md files and the REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table.

## Comparison to Previous Audit

| Metric | Previous (17:25Z) | Current (19:30Z) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Status | gaps_found | tech_debt | ✓ Improved |
| Formally verified | 10/28 | 28/28 | +18 |
| Full 3-source | 10/28 | 18/28 | +8 |
| VERIFICATION.md files | 1/5 phases | 5/5 phases | +4 |
| Critical gaps | 4 (missing VERIFICATIONs) | 0 | Resolved |
| Tech debt items | 6 | 5 | -1 |

**Phase 6 successfully closed all critical gaps identified by the previous audit.**
